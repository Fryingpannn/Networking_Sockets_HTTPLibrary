Parser for HTTP library

General
- Take in text input from cURL
- Convert to one string that can be input into HTTP library directly

Specifics
- Must check the command options. Not all should exist, also different for GET and POST
  (E.g.: GET shouldn't take 'd').

HTTP library receives parameters:
- (HOST, HTTP_METHOD, PATH, QUERY_PARAMS, HEADERS: str "k:v" , BODY_DATA, VERBOSE)
