# Networking Fundamentals: Data Communication and Networks
There are two applications in this repository.

- The first one is in the `./TCP` folder. This consists of a client server application that implements the application layer HTTP protocol by using TCP sockets.
- The second is is in the `./UDP` folder. This consists of a client server application that implements both the applicaiton and transport layer. For the transport layer, it uses UDP sockets and simulates TCP by implementing reliable data transfer with the selective repeat algorithm and 3-way handshaking.
